## 🔍 Project Overview

This project applied **RFM segmentation** to 5,855 Roaster's Club rewards customers of Hecuba Coffee. The goal was to identify which customer groups should be targeted with future email coupon campaigns based on behavioral data and coupon redemption performance.

> Management sought to improve upon the 17% redemption rate from a prior random coupon distribution, while keeping total redemptions under 204.

## 🎯 Key Results

- 📈 **28 RFM Groups** (46.7%) showed coupon return rates higher than the baseline **17%**, accounting for **71.6%** of total redemptions.
- 👥 These high-performing RFM segments achieved an **email coupon return rate of 22.49%**.
- 💰 With strategic targeting and a **47.91% increase in email outreach**, Hecuba can expect to hit the 204 redemption cap and drive **$7,124+ in additional revenue**, with potential to exceed **$10,686** in best-case projections.
